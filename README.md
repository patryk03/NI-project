# NI-project
Project for our IT tools classes

## Description

The main goal of our project is to create a simple game and learn IT tools in the process. We agreed on coding a tetris-like game in Python. As we are not very advanced in Python and have different levels of experience in programming, the technical part of the project will be mostly basic. We are not going to use advanced libraries; we will stick to the ones that we already have some experience with.
